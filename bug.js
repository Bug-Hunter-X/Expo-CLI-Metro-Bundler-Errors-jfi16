This error typically occurs when you try to run an Expo CLI command (like `expo start` or `expo build`) and it fails with a message indicating a problem with the Metro bundler or a dependency.  The specific error message might vary, but it often relates to issues with resolving modules, JavaScript syntax errors in your project code, or problems with the Node.js version or environment variables.
