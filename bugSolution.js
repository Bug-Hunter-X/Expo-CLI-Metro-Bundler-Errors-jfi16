The solution generally involves fixing the underlying code issue, ensuring compatibility with required packages and Node.js versions, and verifying the correctness of environment variables. For this example, a common cause is missing or incorrectly configured dependencies.  The corrected code ensures that all dependencies are installed and correctly imported.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// ... other imports
import React from 'react'; // Ensure React is correctly imported
// ... rest of the corrected app code
```
Make sure you have installed all the required packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
